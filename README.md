# autopilotforUAV
Autopilot for UAVs on an Android smartphone Autonomous UAV flight control system based on Aldroid JAVA projects (working with sensors and issuing control signals) and a learning control unit based on a Neural Network
Autopilot with the ability to learn (like a Neural Network) for the simplest and cheapest polyurethane foam aircraft-type UAVs
The neural network will replace the manual setting of control parameters with the learning process
The task of continuous operation of the application has not yet been added here.
